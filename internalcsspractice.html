        <div class="para">A paragraph is a distinct section of writing that focuses on a single idea or topic, typically made up of several sentences. It is a fundamental unit of organization that helps structure a text and makes it easier for the reader to follow, with the first sentence often acting as a topic sentence that introduces the main point. Supporting sentences then develop that idea with more details, and the paragraph may conclude by summarizing or linking to the next point. </div></p>
