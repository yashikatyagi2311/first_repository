                A new house and a bad feeling
A family is looking at an old house. While one child is excited by the large rooms and garden, the other feels a strange, watching presence. The parents, however, are sold on the house's charm and think the unsettling feeling is just the children's imagination, believing they will make happy memories there once they settle in. 
Strange occurrences
That night, the children can't sleep. One reports seeing a shadow under the door that doesn't belong to them, which the other initially dismisses as a dream. Still, they are both unnerved and decide to stay together in one room with the light on. They hear a noise and tell their parents, who, though they attribute it to the old house, agree to check again. 
The tipping point
The strange events continue, and everyone is scared. The parents witness a strange event themselves, possibly a faulty wire, but the uneasiness is palpable. One child suggests leaving, and the other agrees, but they wait to see if it happens again. The strange occurrences escalate, and everyone feels the need to flee immediately. 
An important lesson
